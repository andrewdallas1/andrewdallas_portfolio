  <h3>About Me</h3>
  <p>I am a dedicated and hard working problem solver. I strive to find efficient
    and effective solutions to each challenge I am faced with. I believe this is
    the reason that I love web development. The satisfaction of reaching a
    project goal or solving a bug and seeing my code work is what drives me.
